## Architecture

### State Management
The app uses React Context with useReducer for state management:
- **Posts**: Array of scheduled and published posts
- **Current Time**: Live updating current time for auto-publishing
- **Actions**: Add posts, publish posts, update time, load from storage

### Data Flow
1. User creates a post with content and scheduled time
2. Post is stored in context state and localStorage
3. Timer checks every second for posts due to publish
4. Due posts are automatically moved to "published" status
5. Timeline updates in real-time to show current state

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Full app workflows
- **Context Tests**: State management logic
- **Mocking**: localStorage, timers, and external dependencies

## Design Decisions

### Mobile-First Approach
- Uses CSS Grid for responsive layout
- Stacks vertically on mobile, side-by-side on desktop
- Touch-friendly form controls and spacing

### Clipped Border Design
- Custom CSS decorations with rotated squares
- Different implementations for mobile vs desktop
- Maintains visual continuity across screen sizes

### Auto-Publishing Logic
- Uses setInterval to check for due posts every second
- Simulates cron job behavior in the browser
- Graceful handling of browser sleep/wake cycles

- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
